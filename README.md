New York City Engineers for a Sustainable World's (NYC-ESW) validation of the [Visionmaker](https://visionmaker.us/nyc/) environmental modeling system's hydrological model. The scripts provided here mine high-certainty flooding events from reports made to the 311 New York City help line. To run the analysis in full, execute `make.sh`. (Note, this will download the source data and may take some time.) For details of the analysis, check out `analysis.ipynb`.

In `outputs_1`, four graphs describing the data are provided. `results.csv` is a brief table of vital statistics about the data used in our report. `311_2015_floods.csv` has a line for each flooding event found and vital statistics for those flooding events. See `analysis.ipynb` or `analysis.py` (different formats, but same content) for more details.
